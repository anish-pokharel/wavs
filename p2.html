        Madhesh Province (Nepali: मधेश प्रदेश, romanized: Madhēśa pradēśa) is a province of Nepal in the Terai region
        with an area of 9,661 km2 (3,730 sq mi) covering about 6.5% of the country's total area. It has a population of
        6,114,600 as per the 2021 Nepal census, making it Nepal's most densely populated province and the smallest
        province by area.[6][7] It borders Koshi Pradesh to the east and the north, Bagmati Province to the north, and
        India’s Bihar state to the south and the west. The border between Chitwan National Park and Parsa National Park
        acts as the provincial boundary in the west, and the Kosi River forms the provincial border in the east. The
        province includes eight districts, from Parsa in the west to Saptari in the east. It is a centre for religious
        and cultural tourism.[8]

        Etymology
        The word madhesh is thought to be derived from the Sanskrit madhya desh (मध्य देश), literally the middle
        country, which refers to "the central region, the country lying between the Himalaya and the Vindhya
        mountains".[9][10] However, in the context of Nepal, Madhesh refers to the region in the Nepal Terai located
        south of the Siwalik Hills.[11][12] Madhesh has also been defined as the cultural and linguistic space existing
        as a basis for identity among the people of the Terai.[13

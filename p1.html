        Etymology
        Main article: Kosi River § Cultural significance
        The province is named Koshi after the Koshi River, which is the largest river in the country. On 1 March 2023
        the former temporary name of the province, Province No. 1, was changed to Koshi Province.[14]

        The Kosi River is significantly and culturally an important river of Nepal. The Koshi River is called Kausika in
        the Rigveda and Kausiki in the Mahabharata.The Kosi is associated with many ancient spiritual stories. It is
        mentioned in the Bal Kand section of Valmiki's Ramayana as the Kausiki who is the form assumed by Satyavati
        after her death. In the Markandeya Purana, the Kosi is described as the primal force. Due to the violent nature
        of the Kosi in monsoon season, legend says that Parvati, the wife of Shiva, after defeating the demon Durg,
        became known as the warrior goddess Durga who transformed into Kaushiki. In Ramayana, the river Ganges is
        depicted as her elder sister.[15] According to Mahabharata epic, the God of death took the form of a woman and
        resides on the banks of the river to limit population growth. Kosi resonates with the folklore of Mithila. The
        most important depictions of Kosi folklore are Kosi as a virgin absolutely carefree and full of energy, and as a
        frustrated wife of old hermit Richeek wandering in the Himalayas. Koshi river is also invoked as the mother:
        'Kosi Ma'.[15]
